Timilsina et al. 2024. SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a mutation found in BF.5 and BF.7 sublineages impacts its functions. *International Journal of Molecular Sciences*. 25: 2351. doi: 10.3390/ijms25042351\
Timilsina et al. 2023. SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a mutation found in BF.5 and BF.7 sublineages impacts its functions. *bioRxiv*. doi: 10.1101/2023.09.06.556547

The EPI_SET_230817yu dataset includes 1,943,768 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in the BA.5 lineage used for random sampling.\
The EPI_SET_230817cf dataset includes 5,226 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 used in phylogenetic tree reconstruction and reconstruction of ancestral states of ORF7a: H47Y substitution (Figure 1A).
